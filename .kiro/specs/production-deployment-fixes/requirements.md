# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The AgentScan Security Scanner application has been deployed to production with the backend on fly.io and frontend on Vercel, but there are critical issues preventing proper functionality. The system currently shows dummy data, has broken API connectivity, non-functional authentication, poor UI/UX, and insecure secrets management. The system needs comprehensive fixes including Supabase authentication integration, proper secrets management, functional scan creation, and a complete UI overhaul to ensure production readiness. This spec addresses all identified issues to make the application fully functional for end users.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: API Connectivity and Configuration

**User Story:** As a frontend user, I want the application to successfully connect to the backend API so that I can access all features without connection errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the frontend loads THEN it SHALL successfully connect to the fly.io backend API
2. WHEN API calls are made THEN they SHALL use the correct production API URL format
3. WHEN environment variables are loaded THEN they SHALL properly configure API endpoints for production
4. IF the API is unavailable THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages with retry options
5. WHEN CORS is configured THEN it SHALL allow requests from the Vercel frontend domain

### Requirement 2: Supabase Authentication Integration

**User Story:** As a user, I want to log in to the application using Supabase authentication so that I can securely access the security scanning features with proper user management.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I submit login credentials THEN the system SHALL authenticate me through Supabase
2. WHEN authentication succeeds THEN I SHALL receive a valid Supabase session token
3. WHEN the token is stored THEN it SHALL persist across browser sessions using Supabase client
4. WHEN I make authenticated requests THEN the Supabase token SHALL be included in headers
5. WHEN the token expires THEN Supabase SHALL handle refresh automatically or redirect to login
6. WHEN I log out THEN my Supabase session SHALL be properly cleared
7. WHEN I sign up THEN I SHALL be able to create a new account through Supabase
8. WHEN I reset my password THEN I SHALL receive a secure reset link via Supabase

### Requirement 3: Frontend UI and Component Fixes

**User Story:** As a user, I want the web interface to load properly and display data correctly so that I can navigate and use all features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN all components SHALL render without errors
2. WHEN data is fetched THEN it SHALL display in the correct format
3. WHEN I navigate between pages THEN routing SHALL work correctly
4. WHEN API responses are received THEN they SHALL be properly parsed and displayed
5. WHEN errors occur THEN they SHALL be handled gracefully with user-friendly messages

### Requirement 4: Backend API Response Format Standardization

**User Story:** As a frontend developer, I want consistent API response formats so that the frontend can reliably parse and display data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API endpoints return data THEN they SHALL use consistent response wrapper format
2. WHEN errors occur THEN they SHALL return standardized error response format
3. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL return proper HTTP status codes
4. WHEN data is paginated THEN it SHALL include proper pagination metadata
5. WHEN health checks are performed THEN they SHALL return standardized health status

### Requirement 5: Production Environment Configuration

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want proper production configuration so that the application runs securely and reliably in production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN it SHALL use production-appropriate settings
2. WHEN environment variables are missing THEN the system SHALL fail fast with clear error messages
3. WHEN CORS is configured THEN it SHALL only allow requests from authorized domains
4. WHEN security headers are set THEN they SHALL follow security best practices
5. WHEN logging is configured THEN it SHALL provide appropriate detail for production monitoring

### Requirement 6: Error Handling and User Experience

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear error messages and loading states so that I understand what's happening and can take appropriate action.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API calls fail THEN I SHALL see specific error messages explaining the issue
2. WHEN data is loading THEN I SHALL see appropriate loading indicators
3. WHEN network errors occur THEN I SHALL see retry options
4. WHEN authentication fails THEN I SHALL be redirected to login with explanation
5. WHEN the system is unavailable THEN I SHALL see a maintenance message with status updates

### Requirement 7: Security and Compliance

**User Story:** As a security-conscious user, I want the application to follow security best practices so that my data and interactions are protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data is transmitted THEN it SHALL use HTTPS encryption
2. WHEN tokens are stored THEN they SHALL be stored securely
3. WHEN API calls are made THEN they SHALL include proper authentication headers
4. WHEN CORS is configured THEN it SHALL prevent unauthorized cross-origin requests
5. WHEN security headers are set THEN they SHALL protect against common attacks

### Requirement 8: Secrets Management with Supabase

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want all API keys and secrets stored securely in Supabase so that sensitive information is not exposed in code or environment files.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API keys are needed THEN they SHALL be retrieved from Supabase secrets management
2. WHEN environment variables contain secrets THEN they SHALL be migrated to Supabase vault
3. WHEN the application starts THEN it SHALL authenticate with Supabase to access secrets
4. WHEN secrets are updated THEN they SHALL be updated in Supabase without code changes
5. WHEN secrets are accessed THEN access SHALL be logged and audited through Supabase

### Requirement 9: Functional Scan Creation and Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want to create new security scans and manage existing ones so that I can actively monitor my repositories for security issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I click "New Scan" THEN I SHALL see a functional scan creation modal
2. WHEN I select a repository THEN the system SHALL validate the repository exists and is accessible
3. WHEN I configure scan parameters THEN I SHALL be able to select agents and scan types
4. WHEN I submit a scan THEN it SHALL be queued and start processing
5. WHEN a scan is running THEN I SHALL see real-time progress updates
6. WHEN a scan completes THEN I SHALL see actual results instead of dummy data
7. WHEN I retry a failed scan THEN it SHALL restart with the same parameters

### Requirement 10: Modern UI/UX Improvements

**User Story:** As a user, I want a modern, intuitive interface that looks professional and functions smoothly so that I can efficiently manage my security scanning workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I load the application THEN I SHALL see a modern, professional design
2. WHEN I navigate between pages THEN transitions SHALL be smooth and responsive
3. WHEN data is loading THEN I SHALL see appropriate loading states and skeletons

7. WHEN I perform actions THEN I SHALL receive clear feedback and confirmation

### Requirement 11: Real Data Integration

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see real data from my security scans instead of dummy data so that I can make informed decisions about my application security.

1. WHEN I view the dashboard THEN I SHALL see actual scan statistics from the database
2. WHEN I view repositories THEN I SHALL see my actual connected repositories
3. WHEN I view scan results THEN I SHALL see real findings from security tools
4. WHEN I view charts and graphs THEN they SHALL display actual trend data
5. WHEN no data exists THEN I SHALL see appropriate empty states with guidance
