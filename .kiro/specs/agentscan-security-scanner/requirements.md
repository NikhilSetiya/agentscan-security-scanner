# Requirements Document

## Introduction

AgentScan is an intelligent security scanner that orchestrates multiple scanning engines to provide developers with accurate, fast security analysis. The system uses multi-agent consensus to dramatically reduce false positives while maintaining comprehensive coverage across multiple programming languages and vulnerability types. The core value proposition is eliminating security debt through intelligent orchestration, reducing false positives by 80% while increasing coverage, all integrated seamlessly into existing developer workflows.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Multi-Agent Scanning Engine

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to run multiple security scanning tools simultaneously so that I can get high-confidence results with minimal false positives.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a scan is initiated THEN the system SHALL execute at least 3 different scanning tools in parallel
2. WHEN multiple tools flag the same issue THEN the system SHALL assign a high confidence score (>95%)
3. WHEN only one tool flags an issue THEN the system SHALL assign a low confidence score and mark as potential false positive
4. WHEN scan results are collected THEN the system SHALL deduplicate similar findings using semantic similarity
5. IF tools disagree on severity THEN the system SHALL use consensus-based scoring to determine final severity

### Requirement 2: Language and Framework Support

**User Story:** As a developer working with multiple technologies, I want comprehensive security analysis across all my codebases so that I don't need different tools for different languages.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN scanning JavaScript/TypeScript code THEN the system SHALL use ESLint security plugins and Semgrep rules
2. WHEN scanning Python code THEN the system SHALL use Bandit and Semgrep Python rules
3. WHEN scanning Go code THEN the system SHALL use golangci-lint security rules and Semgrep Go rules
4. WHEN scanning Java code THEN the system SHALL use appropriate SAST tools for Java vulnerabilities
5. WHEN scanning any supported language THEN the system SHALL auto-detect the language and framework
6. WHEN encountering unsupported languages THEN the system SHALL gracefully skip with appropriate messaging

### Requirement 3: Performance and Speed

**User Story:** As a developer, I want fast security feedback so that security scanning doesn't slow down my development workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN scanning a full repository THEN the system SHALL complete analysis in under 5 minutes for 100k lines of code
2. WHEN scanning incremental changes THEN the system SHALL complete analysis in under 30 seconds for typical PRs
3. WHEN providing IDE feedback THEN the system SHALL respond within 2 seconds for file analysis
4. WHEN multiple scans are requested THEN the system SHALL support at least 1000 concurrent scans
5. IF a scan exceeds time limits THEN the system SHALL provide partial results and timeout gracefully

### Requirement 4: Integration Points

**User Story:** As a developer, I want security scanning integrated into my existing tools and workflow so that I don't need to context switch or learn new interfaces.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN connecting to repositories THEN the system SHALL support GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket APIs
2. WHEN integrated with VS Code THEN the system SHALL provide real-time inline security annotations
3. WHEN integrated with CI/CD THEN the system SHALL support GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, and Jenkins
4. WHEN scan results are available THEN the system SHALL send notifications via Slack and Microsoft Teams
5. IF integration fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and fallback options

### Requirement 5: Result Management and Reporting

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear, actionable security findings with minimal noise so that I can focus on real security issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying findings THEN the system SHALL show severity (High/Medium/Low) based on consensus scoring
2. WHEN showing vulnerability details THEN the system SHALL include file location, line number, and description
3. WHEN multiple tools detect the same issue THEN the system SHALL show which tools flagged the finding
4. WHEN findings are false positives THEN the system SHALL allow one-click suppression
5. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL export results in PDF and JSON formats

### Requirement 6: Dependency and Secret Scanning

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive security analysis including dependencies and secrets so that I can identify all potential security risks in my codebase.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN scanning JavaScript projects THEN the system SHALL run npm audit for dependency vulnerabilities
2. WHEN scanning Python projects THEN the system SHALL run pip-audit for dependency vulnerabilities
3. WHEN scanning Go projects THEN the system SHALL analyze go.mod for vulnerable dependencies
4. WHEN scanning any codebase THEN the system SHALL use truffleHog and git-secrets for secret detection
5. WHEN secrets are detected THEN the system SHALL flag them as high severity findings

### Requirement 7: User Authentication and Access Control

**User Story:** As a team lead, I want secure access control so that only authorized users can access scan results and repository data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users access the system THEN they SHALL authenticate via OAuth with GitHub/GitLab
2. WHEN accessing scan results THEN users SHALL only see results for repositories they have access to
3. WHEN team features are used THEN the system SHALL support role-based access controls
4. WHEN handling sensitive data THEN the system SHALL encrypt data at rest and in transit
5. IF authentication fails THEN the system SHALL deny access and log the attempt

### Requirement 8: Incremental Scanning

**User Story:** As a developer making frequent commits, I want the system to only scan changed code so that I get fast feedback on my recent changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a repository is scanned multiple times THEN the system SHALL identify changed files since last scan
2. WHEN running incremental scans THEN the system SHALL only analyze modified and new files
3. WHEN dependencies change THEN the system SHALL re-run dependency scanning
4. WHEN configuration changes THEN the system SHALL perform a full scan
5. IF incremental scan fails THEN the system SHALL fall back to full repository scan

### Requirement 9: API and Extensibility

**User Story:** As a developer, I want programmatic access to scanning functionality so that I can integrate AgentScan into custom workflows and tools.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the API THEN all endpoints SHALL respond within 200ms for result queries
2. WHEN starting scans via API THEN the system SHALL return job IDs for status tracking
3. WHEN querying scan status THEN the system SHALL provide real-time progress updates
4. WHEN retrieving results THEN the system SHALL support filtering by severity, file, and tool
5. WHEN API limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL return appropriate rate limiting responses

### Requirement 10: Error Handling and Reliability

**User Story:** As a developer, I want reliable scanning service so that my security workflow isn't disrupted by system failures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN individual agents fail THEN the system SHALL continue with remaining agents and report partial results
2. WHEN system components fail THEN the system SHALL implement automatic retry logic with exponential backoff
3. WHEN the system is unavailable THEN it SHALL maintain 99.9% uptime SLA
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and suggested remediation
5. IF critical failures occur THEN the system SHALL gracefully degrade functionality rather than complete failure
