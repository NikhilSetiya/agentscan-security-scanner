# AgentScan Development Scratchpad

## Feature Analysis and Reasoning

### Core Architecture Decisions

#### Multi-Agent Orchestration System
**Reasoning Round 1:**
- Need to run multiple security tools (Semgrep, ESLint, Bandit, etc.) in parallel
- Each tool has different interfaces, output formats, and execution requirements
- Must handle tool failures gracefully without breaking entire scan
- Need standardized result format for consensus analysis

**Reasoning Round 2:**
- Agent interface should be pluggable - new tools can be added easily
- Each agent should be containerized for isolation and consistency
- Need job queue system (Redis) to manage concurrent execution
- Result aggregation must handle semantic similarity (not just exact matches)

**Reasoning Round 3:**
- Consider tool-specific configurations and rule customization
- Need health checks for each agent to detect failures early
- Timeout handling crucial - some tools may hang on certain codebases
- Resource limits per agent to prevent system overload

**Final Decision:**
- Implement Agent interface with Scan(), HealthCheck(), GetConfig() methods
- Use Docker containers for each tool with resource limits
- Redis-based job queue with priority scheduling
- Semantic similarity using vector embeddings for result deduplication

#### Language Detection and Tool Selection
**Reasoning Round 1:**
- Need to auto-detect languages in repository
- Different tools work better for different languages
- Some tools are language-agnostic (secret scanning)
- Must handle polyglot repositories efficiently

**Reasoning Round 2:**
- File extension mapping is insufficient (e.g., .js could be Node.js or browser)
- Need to detect frameworks and dependencies for better tool selection
- Consider build files (package.json, requirements.txt, go.mod) for context
- Some tools require specific setup (Python virtual envs, Node modules)

**Reasoning Round 3:**
- Language detection should be cached to avoid repeated analysis
- Tool selection should be configurable per project
- Need fallback strategies when preferred tools fail
- Consider performance impact of running too many tools

**Final Decision:**
- Implement language detection using file extensions + build file analysis
- Create tool matrix mapping languages to recommended scanners
- Allow project-level tool configuration overrides
- Cache detection results in database

#### Consensus Scoring Algorithm
**Reasoning Round 1:**
- When multiple tools agree, confidence should be high
- Single tool findings are often false positives
- Need to weight tools differently based on historical accuracy
- Severity conflicts need resolution strategy

**Reasoning Round 2:**
- Historical data on fix rates can improve scoring
- User feedback (fixed vs ignored) should influence future scores
- Different vulnerability types may have different consensus patterns
- Need to handle new vulnerability types without historical data

**Reasoning Round 3:**
- Machine learning model could learn from user behavior
- Need baseline scoring for cold start problem
- Consider tool-specific false positive rates
- Severity escalation rules when multiple tools disagree

**Final Decision:**
- Implement weighted consensus based on tool reliability scores
- Use ML model trained on user feedback for continuous improvement
- Baseline scoring: 3+ tools = High, 2 tools = Medium, 1 tool = Low
- Severity resolution: take highest severity when tools disagree

### Performance Optimization Strategies

#### Incremental Scanning
**Reasoning Round 1:**
- Full repository scans are expensive and slow
- Most commits only change small portions of code
- Need to track what changed since last scan
- Dependencies changes require different handling than code changes

**Reasoning Round 2:**
- Git diff analysis can identify changed files
- Some vulnerabilities span multiple files (data flow analysis)
- Configuration changes might affect entire codebase
- Need to handle branch switches and merges correctly

**Reasoning Round 3:**
- Cache scan results per file/commit hash
- Invalidation strategy for cross-file dependencies
- Handle renamed/moved files efficiently
- Consider impact of new rules on existing code

**Final Decision:**
- Implement git-based change detection with file-level granularity
- Cache results using content hash + tool version + rule version
- Full scan triggers: config changes, new tools, major rule updates
- Smart invalidation for cross-file dependencies

#### Parallel Execution
**Reasoning Round 1:**
- Multiple agents should run simultaneously
- Need to manage system resources (CPU, memory, disk)
- Some tools are more resource-intensive than others
- Container orchestration for isolation

**Reasoning Round 2:**
- Queue system needed for managing concurrent jobs
- Priority handling for real-time IDE requests vs batch scans
- Resource allocation per agent type
- Failure isolation - one agent failure shouldn't affect others

**Reasoning Round 3:**
- Consider tool dependencies (some tools need build artifacts)
- Network I/O for downloading dependencies
- Disk space management for temporary files
- Monitoring and alerting for resource exhaustion

**Final Decision:**
- Redis-based job queue with priority levels
- Docker containers with CPU/memory limits per agent
- Resource pool management with overflow handling
- Cleanup jobs for temporary files and containers

### Integration Architecture

#### IDE Integration (VS Code)
**Reasoning Round 1:**
- Real-time feedback requires fast analysis
- Can't run full multi-agent scan on every keystroke
- Need to balance accuracy vs speed for IDE use
- Offline capability when service is unavailable

**Reasoning Round 2:**
- Debounced scanning on file save events
- Lightweight local analysis for immediate feedback
- Full scan results cached and updated asynchronously
- Handle large files that might timeout

**Reasoning Round 3:**
- Extension should work without internet connection
- Local rule caching for common vulnerabilities
- Incremental updates to avoid re-downloading everything
- User preferences for scan aggressiveness vs speed

**Final Decision:**
- Hybrid approach: local lightweight scan + async full scan
- WebSocket connection for real-time result updates
- Local rule cache with periodic updates
- Configurable scan triggers (save, idle, manual)

#### CI/CD Integration
**Reasoning Round 1:**
- Must integrate with existing CI/CD pipelines
- Different platforms have different capabilities
- Need to fail builds on high-severity findings
- Results should be available in CI logs and external systems

**Reasoning Round 2:**
- GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins have different APIs
- Some environments have network restrictions
- Need to handle authentication securely
- Large repositories might exceed CI time limits

**Reasoning Round 3:**
- CLI tool approach provides maximum compatibility
- Docker image for consistent environment
- Configurable thresholds per project
- Incremental scanning crucial for CI performance

**Final Decision:**
- Provide CLI tool that works in any CI environment
- Docker image with all dependencies included
- Configuration via files + environment variables
- Async scanning with webhook results for long-running scans

### Data Architecture

#### Database Schema Design
**Reasoning Round 1:**
- Need to store scan jobs, results, user data
- High read volume for dashboard queries
- Time-series data for trend analysis
- Relationships between repos, scans, findings

**Reasoning Round 2:**
- PostgreSQL for ACID compliance and complex queries
- Redis for caching and job queues
- Consider data retention policies
- Indexing strategy for performance

**Reasoning Round 3:**
- Partitioning for large datasets
- Backup and disaster recovery
- Data privacy and GDPR compliance
- Analytics and reporting requirements

**Final Decision:**
- PostgreSQL primary database with proper indexing
- Redis for caching and job management
- Time-based partitioning for scan results
- Automated cleanup of old scan data

#### Security and Privacy
**Reasoning Round 1:**
- Source code is highly sensitive
- Must not persist code content
- Encryption at rest and in transit
- Access control and audit logging

**Reasoning Round 2:**
- Analyze code in memory only
- Secure container isolation
- API authentication and authorization
- SOC 2 compliance requirements

**Reasoning Round 3:**
- Zero-trust architecture
- Regular security audits
- Incident response procedures
- Data breach notification processes

**Final Decision:**
- No source code persistence - analyze and discard
- End-to-end encryption for all data transmission
- JWT-based API authentication with short expiry
- Comprehensive audit logging for compliance
