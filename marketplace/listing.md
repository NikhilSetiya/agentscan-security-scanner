### 🚨 Troubleshooting

**Common Issues & Solutions:**

1. **Authentication Failed**
   - Ensure `AGENTSCAN_API_KEY` is set as repository secret
   - Verify API key is valid at [agentscan.dev/dashboard](https://agentscan.dev/dashboard)

2. **No Findings Detected**
   - This is good news! Your code appears secure
   - Consider adding the "Secured by AgentScan" badge to your README

3. **Too Many Findings**
   - Start with `fail-on-high: true` and `fail-on-medium: false`
   - Gradually increase strictness as you fix issues
   - Use the AgentScan dashboard to suppress false positives

4. **Scan Timeout**
   - Increase `timeout` parameter
   - Use `exclude-paths` to skip large files
   - Contact support for optimization tips
